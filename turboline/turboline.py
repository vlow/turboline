    The TurboLineCmd is an adjusted version of the usual Python Cmd. If you are
    not familiar with the concept of the Python Cmd, read: https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html

    The Cmd removes a lot of tedious tasks when handling command input in Python programs. It automatically
    supplies auto-completion, maps input to defined commands and much more.

    You can add your own commands by deriving from TurboLineCmd and define commands named do_commandname. So in
    order to create a command named foo, define a method named do_foo. If you want to provide argument completion
    for this command, provide another method named complete_foo (the above link elaborates this a bit more).

    A lot of functionality comes from readline, which we sadly cannot use in Curses.This adjusted version
    adds a new autocomplete implementation which resembles the vim-input behavior:

    1. Try to complete the command
    2. If there is no argument, TAB cycles through possible matches.
    3. If there is an argument, try to complete the command unambiguously.
    4. If the command is valid, try to complete the argument by calling the corresponding complete_commandname method.

    There is a simple helper called _auto_match_list which can be used in argument completion methods (see the
    documentation on it).
